== Description ==

Open Book makes all posts public just by knowing their URLs, whether or not
the post has actually been published. Publishing means adding the
post to the front page and to the RSS feed. Using this plugin means
that, published or not, the post is public as long as you know its
URL. 

You also have to append '?secretpreview' to the URL but that's obviously
not a security measure. Rather, it's to make it obvious that you're viewing a
preview of an unpublished post. To be extra sure that there's no confusion
about that, you could also add a disclaimer at the top that says the post is
still just a draft.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `openbook` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
